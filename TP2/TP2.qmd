# TP2 - Simple Linear Regression

## Problem 1

Height and weight data (Data file: Htwt) The table below and the the data file give ht = height in centimeters and wt = weight in kilograms for a sample of n = 10 18-year-old girls. The interest is in predicting weight from height.

a\. Drawv a scatterplot of $wt$ on the vertical axis versus $ht$ on the horizontal axis. On the basis of the plot, does a simple linear model make sense for these data? Why or why not?

b\. Compute estimates of the slope and the intercept for the regression of $Y$ on $X$. Draw the fitted line on your scatterplot.

c\. Interpret the parameter estimates $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$. Obtain the $t$-tests for the hypotheses that $\beta_0=0$ and $\beta_1=0$ and $p$-values using two-sided tests. what is your conclusion based on the $p$-values.

d\. Obtain $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$. What can you say about them?

e\. Check all the model assumptions for this simple linear regression.

## Problem 2

(Data file: \UBSprices) The international bank UBS regularly produces a report (UBS, 2009) on prices and earnings in major cities throughtout the world. Three of the measures they include are prices of basic commodities, namely 1kg of rice, 1kg loaf of bread, and the price of a Big Mac Hamburger at McDonalds. An interesting feature of the prices they report is that prices are measured in the minuted of labor required for a "typical" worker in that location ti earn enough money to purchase the commodity. Using minutes of labor corrects at least in part for currency fluctuations, prevailing wage rates, and local prices. The data file includes measurements for rice, bread, and Big Mac prices from the 2003 and the 2009 reports. The year 2003 was before the major recession hit much of the world around 2006, and the year 2009 may reflect changed in prices due to the recession. The figure below is the plot of y = `rice2009`{=} versus x = `rice2003`{=texinfo}, the price of rice in 2009 and 2003, respectively, with the cities corresponding to a few of the points marked.

```{r}
library(alr4)
data("UBSprices")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(x=UBSprices$rice2003, y=UBSprices$rice2009,
     xlab="2003 Rice price",
     ylab="2009 Rice price")
#identify(x=UBSprices$rice2003, y=UBSprices$rice2009,
#         labels=row.names(UBSprices), n=5)
abline(lm(rice2009~rice2003, data=UBSprices), lty=2)
abline(a=0, b=1, lty=1)
legend("bottomright", legend=c("ols", "y=x"), lty=2:1, cex=0.6)

plot(x=UBSprices$rice2003, y=UBSprices$rice2009,
     xlab="2003 Rice price",
     ylab="2009 Rice price")
text(x=UBSprices$rice2003, y=UBSprices$rice2009,
     labels=row.names(UBSprices), cex=0.6, font=2)
abline(lm(rice2009~rice2003, data=UBSprices), lty=2)
abline(a=0, b=1, lty=1)
legend("bottomright", legend=c("ols", "y=x"), lty=2:1, cex=0.6)
```

#### a. The line with equation $y=x$ is shown on this plot as the solid line. What is the key difference between points above this line and points below the line?

The solid line $y=x$ represents no change in rice prices between 2003 and 2009.

-   Points above the line ($y>x$): Cities where rice prices increased from 2003 to 2009. The rice price in 2009 is higher than it was in 2003.

-   Points below the line ($y<x$): Cities where rice prices decreased from 2003 to 2009. The rice price in 2009 is lower than it was in 2003.

-   Points on the line: Cities where rice prices remained the same (no change).

#### b. Which city had the largest increase in rice price? Which had the largest decrease in rice price?

Largest increases in rice prices:

-   Vilnius appears to have the largest increase. It had a relatively low price in 2003 (around 10-15 minutes) but a very high price in 2009 (around 75 minutes).

Largest decrease in rice price:

-   Nairobi appears to have the largest decrease. It had a relatively high price in 2003 (around 70 minutes) but dropped to around 50 minutes in 2009.

-   Alternatively, Mumbai also shows a notable decrease, going from around 85 minutes in 2003 to around 35 minutes in 2009 (though this seems extreme and might warrant data verification).

#### c. The ols line $\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1x$ is shown on the figure as a dashed line, and evidently $\hat{\beta}_1<1$. Does this suggest that prices are lower in 2009 than in 2003? Explain your answer.

No, $\hat{\beta_1}<1$ does not necessarily mean that prices are lower in 2009 than in 2003.

The OLS line is: $\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1x$

-   If $\hat{\beta}_1<1$, this means that for every 1 minute increase in 2003 rice price, the 2009 rice price increase by less than 1 minute (on average).
-   This indicates convergence or "regression to the mean": cities with very high prices in 2003 tend to have somewhat lower relative increases (or even decreases) by 2009, while cities with low prices in 2003 might have proportionally larger increases.
-   Whether prices are higher or lower in 2009 depends on both $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$, not just $\hat{\beta}_1$ alone.

For example, if $\hat{\beta}_0=5$ and $\hat{\beta}_1=0.8$:

-   A city with $x=10$ in 2003 would have $\hat{y}=5+0.8(10)=13$ in 2009 (increase)

-   A city with $x=20$ in 2003 would have $\hat{y}=5+0.8(20)=21$ in 2009 (increase)

The intercept $\hat{\beta_0}<0$ suggest that even cities with zero 2003 prices would have positive 2009 prices, indicating an overall upward shift. Looking at the graph, most points are indeed above the lower-left origin area, suggesting general price increases despite $\hat{\beta_1}<1$.

#### d. Give two reasons why fitting simple linear regression to the figure in this problem is not likely to be appropriate.

1.  **Heteroscedasticity (Non-constant variance):**
    -   The scatter of points clearly increases as x increases. Cities with low 2003 prices (left side of plot) show relatively tight clustering, while cities with high 2003 prices (right side) show much greater variability in their 2009 prices.

    -   This violates the constant variance assumption of linear regression, making standard errors and confidence intervals unreliable.

    -   The points appear to fan out as you move from left to right.
2.  **Non-linear relationship / Outliers:**
    -   The relationship doesn't appear strictly linear. There are several **influential outliers** (like Vilnius at top left and possibly Nairobi/Mumbai at the right) that may be unduly influencing the fitted line.

    -   The curvature in the relationship is suggested by how the points cluster: there's a dense cluster at the lower left, and the points don't follow a consistent linear pattern throughout.

    -   **Alternatively**: The data shows a multiplicative rather than additive relationship (prices tend to change proportionally), which suggests a **log transformation** would be more appropriate (as explored in your first question).

**Additional consideration**: The presence of such extreme outliers (Vilnius, Nairobi, Mumbai) suggests that a few cities experienced very unusual economic conditions that may not be well-captured by a simple linear model fit to all cities together.

## Problem 3

(Data file: `UBSprices`{=bibtex}) This is a continuation of Problem 2. An alternative representation of the data used in the last problem is to use log scales, as in the following figure:

```{r}
plot(x=log(UBSprices$rice2003), y=log(UBSprices$rice2009),
     xlab="log(2003 Rice price)",
     ylab="log(2009 Rice price)")

abline(lm(log(rice2009)~log(rice2003), data=UBSprices), lty=2)
abline(a=0, b=1, lty=1)
legend("bottomright", legend=c("ols", "y=x"), lty=2:1, cex=0.6)
```

#### a. Explain why this graph and the graph in Problem 2 suggests that using log-scale is preferable if fitting simple linear regression is desired.

1.  **Linearization of the relationship:** The log-log plot shows a much more linear relationship between the variables. The dashed lines (OLS fitted line) closely follows the pattern of the data points, whereas in the original scale in problem 2, the relationship likely exhibited curvature or heteroscedasticity.
2.  **Reduction of heteroscedasticity:** In the original scale. the variance of y typically increase with x (larger prices have larger variability). Taking logs stabilizes the variance, making the scatter more uniform acrosss the range of x values. Notice how the points are relatively evenly distributed around the fitted line throughout the range.
3.  Better handling of outliers: The log transformation compresses the scale, making extreme values less influential without eliminating them entirely.
4.  Improved residual behavior: The log transformation often makes residuals more normally distributed and homoscedastic, which are key assumptions for linear regression.

#### b. Suppose we start with a proposed model

#### $$E(y|x)=\gamma_0x^{\beta_1}$$
This is a common model in many areas of study. Examples include allometry (Gould, 1966), where x could represent the size of one body characteristic such as total weight and y represents some other body characteristic, such as brain weight, psychophysics (Stevens, 1966), in which x is a physical stimulus and y is a psychological response to it, or in economics, where x could represent inputs and y outputs, where this relationship is often called a Cobb-Douglas production function (Greene, 2003).

#### If we take the logs of both sides of the last equation, we get

#### $$\log(E(y|x))=\log(\gamma_0)+\beta_1\log(x)$$

#### If we approximate $\log(E(y|x))\approx E(\log(y)|x)$, and write $\beta_0=\log(\gamma_0)$, to the extent that the logarithm of the expectation equals the expectation of the logarithm, we have

#### $$E(\log(y)|x)=\beta_0+\beta_1\log(x)$$

#### Give an interpretation of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in this setting, assuming $\beta_1>0$.

\>\>\>

Starting with the power law model:

$$
E(y|x)=γ_0xβ_1
$$

After taking logs and making the approximation, we get:

$$
E(log(y)|x)=β_0+β_1log(x)
$$

where $\beta_0=\log(\gamma_0)$.

Interpretation of $\beta_1$ (assuming $\beta_1>0$):

$\beta_1$ represent the elasticity of y with respect to x. Specifically:

-   $\beta_1$ is the percentage change in y associated with a 1% increase in x

-   Mathematically: if x increase by 1%, then y increases by approximately $\beta_1$%

-   This is because: $\frac{d\log(y)}{d\log(x)}=\beta_1$

For example:

-   If $\beta_1=1$, the relationship is proportional (y=x line): a 1% increase in x leads to a 1% increase in x leads to a 1% increase y

-   If $\beta_1=0.5$, a 1% increase in c leads to a 0.5% increase in y (diminishing returns)

-   If $\beta_1=1.5$, a 1% increase in x leads to 1.5% increase in y (increasing returns)

Interpretation of $\beta_0$:

$\beta_0=\log(\gamma_0)$, so $\gamma_0=\exp(\beta_0)$

-   $\gamma_0$ represents the value of $E(y|x)$ when $x=1$

-   In the original power law model: when $x=1$, $E(y|1)=\gamma_0(1)^{\beta_1}=\gamma_0$

-   $\beta_0$ is the log of this baseline value

In the context of your graph (rice prices), if $\beta_1\approx1$ (as suggested by the proximity of the OLS line to the y=x line), this would indicate that rice prices in 2009 and 2003 are roughly proportional - countries with higher prices in 2003 tend to have proportionally higher prices in 2009, maintaining relative price relationships.

## Problem 4

(Data file: \UBSprices) This problem continues with the data file \UBSprices described in Problem 2.

#### a. Draw the plot of `y=bigmac2009`{=} versus `x=bigmac2003`{=}, the price of a Big Mac hamburger in 2009 and 2003. On this plot draw (1) the ols fitted line; (2) the line y= x. Identify the most unusual cases and describe why they are unusual.

```{r}
# Left plot: without labels
plot(UBSprices$bigmac2003, UBSprices$bigmac2009,
     xlab = "2003 Big Mac price (minutes of labor)",
     ylab = "2009 Big Mac price (minutes of labor)",
     main = "Big Mac Prices: 2009 vs 2003",
     pch = 1, cex = 1.2)

# Fit OLS regression
fit <- lm(bigmac2009 ~ bigmac2003, data = UBSprices)

# Add OLS fitted line (dashed)
abline(fit, lty = 2, lwd = 2)

# Add y=x line (solid)
abline(0, 1, lty = 1, lwd = 2)

# Add legend
legend("topleft", legend = c("ols", "y=x"), 
       lty = c(2, 1), lwd = 2, cex = 0.8)

# Right plot: with city labels for unusual cases
plot(UBSprices$bigmac2003, UBSprices$bigmac2009,
     xlab = "2003 Big Mac price (minutes of labor)",
     ylab = "2009 Big Mac price (minutes of labor)",
     main = "Big Mac Prices with City Labels",
     pch = 1, cex = 1.2)

# Add lines
abline(fit, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
abline(0, 1, lty = 1, lwd = 2)

# Identify unusual cases
# Calculate residuals and leverage
residuals <- residuals(fit)
fitted_vals <- fitted(fit)
std_resid <- rstandard(fit)

# Find unusual points (large residuals or high leverage)
unusual <- abs(std_resid) > 2 | UBSprices$bigmac2003 > 100 | 
           UBSprices$bigmac2009 > 120

# Label unusual cities
text(UBSprices$bigmac2003[unusual], 
     UBSprices$bigmac2009[unusual],
     labels = rownames(UBSprices)[unusual],
     pos = 3, cex = 0.7)

legend("topleft", legend = c("ols", "y=x"), 
       lty = c(2, 1), lwd = 2, cex = 0.8)

```

```{r}
cat("\nRegression Summary:\n")
print(summary(fit))

cat("\nMost Unusual Cities:\n")
unusual_cities <- data.frame(
  City = rownames(UBSprices)[unusual],
  BigMac2003 = UBSprices$bigmac2003[unusual],
  BigMac2009 = UBSprices$bigmac2009[unusual],
  Change = UBSprices$bigmac2009[unusual] - UBSprices$bigmac2003[unusual],
  StdResid = std_resid[unusual]
)
print(unusual_cities[order(-abs(unusual_cities$StdResid)),])

```

#### b. Give two reasons why fitting simple linear regression to the figure in this problem is not likely to be appropriate.

```{r}
# 1. Residual vs Fitted plot (check for non-constant variance)
plot(fitted_vals, residuals,
     xlab = "Fitted values",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = "red")
lines(lowess(fitted_vals, residuals), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

# 2. Scale-Location plot (check for heteroscedasticity)
plot(fitted_vals, sqrt(abs(std_resid)),
     xlab = "Fitted values",
     ylab = "√|Standardized Residuals|",
     main = "Scale-Location Plot")
lines(lowess(fitted_vals, sqrt(abs(std_resid))), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

# 3. Q-Q plot (check for normality)
qqnorm(std_resid, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot")
qqline(std_resid, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# 4. Residuals vs Leverage (check for influential points)
plot(hatvalues(fit), std_resid,
     xlab = "Leverage",
     ylab = "Standardized Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Leverage")
abline(h = c(-2, 0, 2), lty = 2, col = "gray")

```

**Reason 1: Heteroscedasticity**

-   The residual vs fitted plot will show that variance increases with fitted values

-   This "fanning out" pattern violates the constant variance assumption

-   Larger predicted values have larger residual spread

**Reason 2: Influential Outliers**

-   Several cities with extreme prices heavily influence the regression line

-   These outliers may not represent the general pattern

-   Q-Q plot and leverage plots identify these influential points

#### c. Plot log(`bigmac2009`{=}) versus log() and explain(`bigmac2003`{=}) why this graph is more sensibly summarized with a linear regression.

```{r}
# Calculate log transformations (removing any non-positive values)
valid_data <- UBSprices$bigmac2003 > 0 & UBSprices$bigmac2009 > 0
log_bigmac2003 <- log(UBSprices$bigmac2003[valid_data])
log_bigmac2009 <- log(UBSprices$bigmac2009[valid_data])
valid_cities <- rownames(UBSprices)[valid_data]

# Left plot: log-log without labels
plot(log_bigmac2003, log_bigmac2009,
     xlab = "log(2003 Big Mac price)",
     ylab = "log(2009 Big Mac price)",
     main = "Log-Log Plot of Big Mac Prices",
     pch = 1, cex = 1.2)

# Fit OLS on log scale
fit_log <- lm(log_bigmac2009 ~ log_bigmac2003)
abline(fit_log, lty = 2, lwd = 2)
abline(0, 1, lty = 1, lwd = 2)

legend("topleft", legend = c("ols", "y=x"), 
       lty = c(2, 1), lwd = 2, cex = 0.8)

# Right plot: with residual analysis
residuals_log <- residuals(fit_log)
fitted_log <- fitted(fit_log)

plot(fitted_log, residuals_log,
     xlab = "Fitted log(2009 price)",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted (Log Scale)",
     pch = 1)
abline(h = 0, lty = 2, col = "red", lwd = 2)
lines(lowess(fitted_log, residuals_log), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

```

```{r}
cat("\nLog-scale regression summary:\n")
print(summary(fit_log))

cat("\nComparison of model fits:\n")
cat(sprintf("Original scale R²: %.4f\n", summary(fit)$r.squared))
cat(sprintf("Log scale R²: %.4f\n", summary(fit_log)$r.squared))
```

**Reason 1: Linearization**

-   The log-log relationship is much more linear than the original scale

-   Points cluster more evenly around the regression line

**Reason 2: Homoscedasticity**

-   Residual variance becomes more constant across the range

-   The residual plot shows more uniform scatter

**Reason 3: Multiplicative Effects**

-   The slope in log-log represents **elasticity**: the percentage change in 2009 prices for a 1% change in 2003 prices

-   This multiplicative relationship is more natural for economic data

-   Prices tend to change proportionally rather than additively

#### 
Problem 5

**Ft. Collins temperature data** (Data file: \ftcollinstemp) The data file gives the mean temperature in the \fall of each year, defined as September 1 to November 30, and the mean temperature in the following \winter, defined as December 1 to the end of February in the following calendar year, in degrees Fahrenheit, for Ft. Collins, CO (Colorado Climate Center, 2012). These data cover the time period from 1900 to 2010. The question of interest is: Does the average \fall temperature predict the average \winter temperature?

```{r}
library(alr4)
data("ftcollinstemp")
head(ftcollinstemp)
```

a\. Draw a scatterplot of the response versus the predictor, and describe any pattern you might see in the plot.

b\. Use statistical software to fit the regression of the response on the predictor. Add the fitted line to your graph. Test the slope to be 0 against a two-sided alternative, and summarize your results.

c\. Compute or obtain from your computer output the value of the variability in winter explained by fall and explain what this means.

d\. Divide the data into 2 time periods, an early period from 1900 to 1989, and a late period from 1990 to 2010. You can do this using the variable year in the data file. Are the results different in the two time periods?
